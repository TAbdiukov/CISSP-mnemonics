SLE = AV x EF  



## Laws and regulations

* SOX (Sarbanes Oxley, 2002) ‚Äì [say in British accent] ENRON really SOX. Its transaction flow really SOX.

* Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) ‚Äì banks, lenders, insurance. Think about some **fat banker** Gramm (or Graham)  
	![Banker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/The_Banker%2C_by_Isidor_Kaufmann.jpg/201px-The_Banker%2C_by_Isidor_Kaufmann.jpg)

* COPPA ‚Äì Protects minors 13 or younger online. If you are an **online pedo**, then you **cop it**

* FERPA ‚Äì Protects Student data for over 18. Think about Phineas and **FerP**. They have to grow up eventually and go to college. It would be really unfortunate for Phineas and **FerP** fans if **FerP**'s student card is leaked to public!  
	![Ferp grown up imagery](https://i.imgur.com/9EmTji7m.jpg)  
	*However, student ID leak won't trigger data breach laws.*


* **GISMA ‚Äì Superseded by FISMA** in 2000

* FISMA ‚Äì **U.S. Government information security** is under **prisma**. [NIST SP 800-53 is used for FISMA]

* PCI DSS ‚Äì Credit Card Security ‚Äì Visa, MasterCard and American Express. What else is a card other than a credit card? ‚Äì Your PCI card.

	Note: PCI DS**S** is a **Standard**, not a law.

* Digital Millenium **Copyright** Act (DMCA) ‚Äì **Copyright**. Who hadn't heard of the DMCA strikes on Youtube? 

### U.S. Privacy

* 4th Amendment in American Constitution grants right to privacy

* Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ‚Äì CFAA 1986 ‚Äì **First** major legislation to fight cybercrime. Think: **CFAA ‚Äì F for First**.

#### ECPA, CALEA, USA PATRIOT Act

* Electronic Communications Privacy Act ‚Äì ECPA 1986 ‚Äì Makes it illegal to invade electronic privacy of an individual.
* Communication Assurance for Law Enforcement Act ‚Äì CALEA 1994 ‚Äì Amends ECPA to make wiretaps possible for law enforcement, regardless of technology used.
* USA PATRIOT Act of **2001** ‚Äì Broadened wiretapping authorizations, no thanks to 9/11 in 2001.

Think of ECPA and CALEA ‚Äì as a seed and a flower. Yes, calea is a plant, but let's make CALEA a CAULIPOWER with sour taste. ECPA grows into CALEA flower. Then terrorists come, and the garden of CALEA has to be destroyed. Like the privacy had to be destroyed.

### U.S. Import and Export

* Export Administration Regulation (EAR) ‚Äì restricting export of **civilian items that may have military applications**, such as **EARphones**.
* International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) ‚Äì restricting export of **war items**. Think "**ITAR is war**". Russia has a century-old **pro-war** newsagency of **[ITAR-TASS](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ITAR-TASS)**, and when Russia started its **full-scale war**, U.S. already had Russia added to [ITAR list](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/18/2021-05530/international-traffic-in-arms-regulations-addition-of-russia).

### Personal information

* P**I**I ‚Äì Personal **ID** information 
* P**H**I ‚Äì Personal **Health** Information
* P**C**I ‚Äì **Credit card**. **PCI** DSS applies

### U.S. Healthcare

* **HITECH** ‚Äì **Hospitals security** go hi-tech!

### EU

* GDPR ‚Äì EU Privacy Laws ‚Äì cause cookie banners

	![Thanks GDPR](https://www.cookiebot.com/media/4333/consent_en.png) |
	---- |
	~~#ThanksObama~~ #ThanksGDPR

### Extras

* **California** Consumer **Privacy** Act ‚Äì CCPA ‚Äì in **California** only, require **Privacy** Statements from organizations. Similar **mandatory** effects to the EU's GDPR. Remember California=Privacy.
* **HSA** ‚Äì Homeland Security Act. Creation of Homeland Security in the US. Mnemonic: "HSA is like HoUSA. HoUSA can be understood as "House" (my house is my castle) and "Home is USA". Related to HSA (2002) is USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.

## Security and Risk in the U.S.

* US**PT**O ‚Äì **P**atents and **T**rademarks ‚Äì (U.S. Patent & Trademark Office)
* LO**C** ‚Äì **C**opyright ‚Äì (Library of Congress)

### Types of risk

* **In**herent ‚Äì **In**itial risk **in**put before treatment
* **Re**sidual ‚Äì **Re**maining risk **residing** after treatment

## Qualitative & quantitative risk analysis

*(No memory device here, more of an explanation)*

* Qualitative ‚Äì based on guestimates, inference and basic algorithms e.g., FAIR method (probability / impact) or ALE CAUSES AROSLE. Best for hard-to-quantify intangible assets.
* Quantitative ‚Äì **better**, based on experience and statistics
* Combination ‚Äì balanced

## Risk ‚Äì RMF ‚Äì NIST SP 800-37

* [Useful nist.gov illustration](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)

DRP is a subset of BCP

* BCP ‚Äì Business
* DRP ‚Äì Technical

### NIST SP 800-34

DC I DD PP

[NSFL but rememberable memorization trick](https://pastebin.com/raw/fnFEP8cT), oh boy will you need DRP and thus BCP after this

* Develop (policy)

#### BIA process

(No known memory device, just needs to be understood)

1) Project Planning and Development
2) Data collection
3) Criticality Assessment
4) Vulnerability assessment

## Recovery acronyms

* RPO ‚Äì Recovery **Point** Objective ‚Äì time period: From last (known good) scheduled backup to disaster (from past to present). **Point** ‚Äì think about last known good configuration for Windows,  

	![Advanced Boot Options Windows 7](https://neosmart.net/wiki/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/09/Advanced-Boot-Options.jpg) |
	---- | 
	Last Known Good **Point** in time

* RTO ‚Äì Recovery **Time** Objective ‚Äì time period: from disaster to recovery, if all goes well (from present to the future).

* WRT ‚Äì How much **work** for **technical** staff to reconfigure everything after recovery.

* MTD ‚Äì Maximum tolerable downtime for **business**. For CISSP: MTD = RTO + WRT. In reality, YMMV.

# Domain 2

## Data roles

* Data **O**wner ‚Äì (responsible) **O**verall 
* Data **P**rocessor ‚Äì **P**rocesses **P**assed-on (database)

* Data **C**ustodian ‚Äì (responsible for) **C**omputer (with database)
* Data **S**teward ‚Äì (responsible for) **S**yndicate data *everyday* ["Syndicate" as in "Business", so responsible for business data.]

* **A**dministrators ‚Äì **A**ssign permissions to **A**ccounts

### Extras

* Data Controller ‚Äì same as Data Owner

## Data remanence

CISSPrep has a great mnemonic,

To memorize this, repeat the phrase ‚ÄúCow, Pig, Sow,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCP SOW.‚Äù Repeat it again and think of a farm you visited or one that you saw in a movie. Now repeat the following mnemonic:

* **C**learing Can (be recovered)

* **P**urging is **P**ermanent

* **S**anitizing is the **S**ame (as purging)

* **O**verwriting with **O**h's.

* **W**iping is **W**riting (overwriting, that is)

Notice how the letters match to help you remember. It seems silly, yes, but this is the key.  

So here‚Äôs the phrase to keep repeating, once again:

Cow Pig Sow; CPSOW, **Clearing Can, Purging is Permanent, Sanitizing Same, Overwriting Oh‚Äôs, Wiping is Writing.** Repeat this over and over, and consider copying it onto a memorization sheet.

## Scoping, tailoring and supplementation

* Scoping ‚Äì removing security controls that don't apply in your particular case. 
* Tailoring ‚Äì tweaking little details of applied security controls to better suit your organization.
* Supplementation ‚Äì Specify used product names. For example, replace "OS" with "Windows".

There are two mnemonic devices.

### First

Think about a digital telescope pointing at the stars. 

* When you **Scope**, you zoom-in, and you **no longer see stars you are not interested in**
* When you **Tailor**, you **tweak your zoom to see stars clearer**
* When you **Supplement**, you take a photo of the galaxy, print it out, and then in the photo, **circle and name each star with a pen**.

### Second

* **Scoping** is **Subtracting** (controls)
* **Tailoring** is **Tweaking** (controls)
* **Supplementing** is **Specifying** (names)

# Domain 3

## Must-know

### Security rings,

(Zero) KODU ‚Äì Kernel, OS, Drivers, Userspace

### Information flow security models

Total: 5 security models to know

* *Memorization trick 1*: Similarly categorizable models come one after another in alphabetical order!
* *Memorization trick 2*: **I**ntegrity models have **I** in it, Confidentiality models do not.

#### No-{{Action}}-Arrow models

1. Bell-LaPadula ‚Äì (Confidentiality model) Like a BELL üõéÔ∏è: No Read Up‚Üë, no Write Down‚Üì.  
    Compiled: No**R**‚ÜëüõéNo**W**‚Üì.
2. B**i**ba ‚Äì (**I**ntegrity model) Opposite of Bell-LaPadula: No Read‚Üì, no Write Up‚Üë.  
    Compiled: No**R**‚Üì**‚ñΩ**No**W**‚Üë.

#### Brewer&Nash, Clark-Wilson

3. Brewer&Nash: Think Chinese Brew tea ‚Äì Chinese Wall. Walls off conflict-of-interest.  
![Brewer Tea](https://d27pcll2dx97vv.cloudfront.net/info/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Brew-the-Famous-Chinese-Bi-Luo-Chun.jpg)  

4. Clark-W**i**lson ‚Äì (**I**ntegrity model) Use software to access data. **Clerk** uses **WinStone** software to access business data.

#### 5. TAKE-GRANT security model
*2 words, 4 commands.*

* Brownout ‚Äì alike to blackout ‚Äì long-term

### HI Electricity

* Spike ‚Äì Spikes are momentary
* Surge ‚Äì Like in**surgencies**, they can last long!

## Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)

* Natural **Access Control** ‚Äì Fences to enforce authZ
* Natural **Surveillance** ‚Äì Remove trees so nobody can hide over trees 
* Natural **Territorial Reinforcement** ‚Äì Large windows to asset surveillance

-----------------------

What is **not** environmentally enforceable: AuthN.

## Card types

-----------------------
* **Acc**reditation ‚Äì **Ac**e's **C**ompliance (senior manager)
-----------------------
* **Accept**ance ‚Äì **Accept**

 
## IPSec

To remember IPSec, one needs to remember the following memory device: "IPSec is 2". What is 2?

* 2 of IPSec: **IP** + **Sec**

* 2 of Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): **Confidentiality** + **Integrity**
* 2 of **Authentication** header (AH): "**Authentication**" + **Integrity**

## System Modes

From least secure to most secure:

Multilevel ‚Üí Compartmented ‚Üí System-High ‚Üí Dedicated  
M ‚Üí C ‚Üí S ‚Üí D 

Make up a story, e.g. "MC gives you a porn SD card.",  
	![128gb](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BrcBKpE9aQg/mqdefault.jpg)  

Progression of requirements for ALL information (therefore, next entry would apply for SOME information),

NDA ‚Üí Clearance ‚Üí Formal Approval ‚Üí Need-to-know

NC‚ÜíF‚ÜíN -> NoiCy FaN [in the background]

Example: Compartmented ‚Äì NDA for ALL info, Clearance for ALL information, Formal approval for SOME information, Need-to-know for some information.

## Access Control Models

* **D**iscretionary ‚Äì **D**ata owner **d**iscerns **d**irectly. [thus ACLs are in use]

* Non-discretionary ‚Äì everything more streamlined:
	* **M**andatory (MAC) ‚Äì **M**ilitary, and therefore strict and not scalable. Enforced by the OS. Clearances, formal approvals and need-to-know apply.

	All other options are easier to remember,
	* Attribute (ABAC) / Policy (PBAC) ‚Äì attribute/policy ‚Äì high-level rules, flexible use of attributes, location and environment.
	* Role-based (RBAC) ‚Äì role
	* Rule-based (RuBAC) ‚Äì rule ‚Äì dumb rules for robots. example: firewalls
		* Risk-based (~~RiBAC~~ RBA, subtype of RuBAC) ‚Äì risk. For example, IP from China increases risk score.
	
### Related concepts

* ACLs ‚Äì Access Control **Lists**. Blacklists or whitelists. Focus on Objects. Used in DAC.
* Capability table ‚Äì Used for subjects in DAC. `sudoers` file is an example of Capability table.
* AC Matrix ‚Äì 2D matrix with subjects and objects in DAC/MAC.
* **L**attice model ‚Äì matrix of **L**abels on objects and subjects in MAC

# Domain 4

## Must-know

* [DES Modes of Operation](https://github.com/TheRealBenForce/cissp-mnemonics#des-modes-of-operation)

## OSI, TCP/IP

![Protocols](https://i.redd.it/pbn3wokfwd3a1.jpg)

### TCP/IP Model

![Difference](https://adriancitu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/osivstcp.jpg)  

An amazing mnemonic from CISSPrep,

> The TCP/IP model on the right side can be memorized by saying/writing ‚Äú**N2, A3**,‚Äù with ‚ÄúIT‚Äù in the middle, or ‚Äú**NitA**‚Äù, which could be someone‚Äôs name.  

**NOTE**: The mnemonic applies from bottom to top.

### Segments, Packets, Frames, Bits

Taken from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/tw10js/comment/i3ckssx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),

> Some people F*** Bit**es

* Segments ‚Äì TCP ‚Äì Transport layer
* Packets ‚Äì Netzwerking layer
* Frames ‚Äì Data-link layer
* Bits ‚Äì Physical layer

## Authentication protocols

*(typically)*

* Kerberos ‚Äì for Microsoft Windows
* RADIUS ‚Äì for VPN
* TACACS+ ‚Äì for Cisco

Mnemonic device ‚Äì made up a little story: You send documents from Microsoft Windows via VPN to a mainframe serviced by Cisco. The corresponding authentication protocols would go in the alphabetical order.

### Kerberos

![Cerberus](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ageofempires/images/a/a5/TitanGreekIcon.png)  
Heads/Steps: Authentication (KDC), Authorization (TGS gives TGT Ticket), Acceptance

KATANA: KDC Authenticates, TGS Authorizes, nginx accepts.
(You can use KATANA to chop off Kerberos's heads)

## SSL vs TLS

For CISSP: SSL is outdated and TLS is to be used.

## Virtual networking

VX**LAN** for **LAN**, SD**WAN** for **WAN**

## VoIP and VPN

For CISSP: VoIP doesn't mix well with VPN

## Routing protocols

* Distance-vector ‚Äì Shortest **distance**
* Link-state ‚Äì Best bandwidth **link**. Sophisticated. Network map is created.

## NAC systems

**NAC** ‚Äì Network Access Control

Note: They use **Risk** BAC, as they evaluate **risk**

* Pre-admit ‚Äì Checks happen BEFORE admission
* Postadmission ‚Äì Checks happen AFTER admission
* Client-based ‚Äì Stateful
* Clientless ‚Äì Stateless

## *Casts

Mnemonic device: They go in reserve alphabetical order

* Unicast ‚Äì One
* Multicast ‚Äì Many specific
* Broadcast ‚Äì All

## Dial-Up

[Dial-Up refresher](https://www.dialupsound.com/)

* PPP (point-to-point protocol) ‚Äì IP over telephone,  
![DialUpPPP](https://sites.radford.edu/~helpdesk/ppp/95gifs/Welcome.gif)

### Authentication protocols (AP's)

* **P**-**AP** (PAP), ‚Äì Insecure, **P** for **P**athetic
* **CH**-**AP** (CHAP) ‚Äì Secure, uses **CH**ecksums (hash functions)
* **MS**-CHAP ‚Äì Microsoft-improved CHAP. Even more secure, uses **CH**ecksums (hash functions)

## *EAP

* EAP ‚Äì Original protocol that started its family. Outdated
* LEAP ‚Äì Lightweight, Cisco proprietary, no longer secure
* PEAP ‚Äì Protected EAP. For CISSP purposes, "good enough". Uses TLS.
* MS-PEAP ‚Äì Microsoft's improvement on PEAP, even better than PEAP
* EAP-TLS ‚Äì Secure, but difficult to implement due to additional prerequisites

## Bluetooth

* Bluejack ‚Äì Jack sends annoying messages
* Bluesnarf ‚Äì snatch data
* Bluebugging ‚Äì bug to gain remote access

Bluetooth "authZ" is 4-digits.

## internet storage

* iSCSI ‚Äì IP/Ethernet 

## RFC 1918 (Private) IP ranges

* Class A: 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255
* Class B: 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255
* Class C: 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255

### Private IP ranges' subnet masks

Easy trick: class letter defines the number of 255's from left to right. For example, class B (2) would have 255.255.0.0

## Fraggle, Smurf

* Fraggle ‚Äì [CHARGEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0mXoF7dHVA)
* Smurf ‚Äì ICMP

## FTP, SSH, Telnet

Memory device ‚Äì They are in alphabetic order,

* 20-21 ‚Äì FTP
* 22 ‚Äì SSH
* 23 ‚Äì Telnet

## Port status

Mnemonic device: This information is VERY obvious, so what do I say? Of Course! Or OFC:

* Open ‚Äì Worst
* Filtered ‚Äì OK
* Closed ‚Äì Best

# Domain 5

## Must-know

Quote from ~~[DerreckM/CISSP-Mnemonics](https://github.com/DerreckM/CISSP-Mnemonics)~~ ([mirror](https://github.com/khwajaimran/CISSP-Mnemonics))

* Retinal scan is most intrusive to privacy (*think ret-inal = anal, intrusive!  It's inappropriate, but you remember it!) 

* Using a condom is **due care**, taking the steps to decide whether to use the condom is **due diligence**. (Source: Luke Ahmed)

## Authentication problems

![Authentication types](https://datavizblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/type-i-and-type-ii-errors-simplified.jpg)  

"Rejection" is a "positive" for authN systems.

* FRR ‚Äì Type 1 Error
* FAR ‚Äì Type 2 Error
* CER ‚Äì Intersection between FAR and FRR. Optimal configuration.

Mnemonic device: FRR FAR, CER (meaning [Freier](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Freier#Noun)'s far, sire)

## More about AAA protocols

* Kerberos ‚Äì symmetric AES encryption everywhere, but unique stateless system.
* RADI**U**S ‚Äì **U**DP, can extraordinarily support TLS over TCP, only encrypts passwords. Like it is for VPNs, not a single sign-on
* **T**ACACS+ ‚Äì **T**CP, encrypts full session.

### *Open* / Third-party logon

Think: Google, Github, Microsoft logon.

* Open**ID** ‚Äì **Id**entity ‚Üí Authentication
* OAuth ‚Äì (stands for) Open Authorization

**Note**: In real life, these protocols are used vis-a-vis.

### XML-based-languages

* S**A**ML ‚Äì **A**uthN and **A**uthZ, open source, good for ADFS.
* S**P**ML ‚Äì **S**ervice **P**rovisioning
* X**AC**ML ‚Äì Access control (AuthZ but not AuthN)
* SOAP ‚Äì messaging over network

## PRivileges

* **P**ermissions ‚Äì for **P**C (for example, execute permissions on files in Linux)
* **R**ights ‚Äì for **R**eal-life (for example, right to bear arms)

* **PR**ivileges = **P**ermissions + **R**ights

3) Use
4) Share
5) Archive
6) Destroy

* Letters: CS US AD
* Mnemonic: CompSci (of) US (created) ActiveDirectory

## Evidence

### By format

* Real ‚Äì Real physical Objects
* Documentary ‚Äì Docs
* Testimonial ‚Äì Witness

### By reliability

* Primary ‚Äì Originals
* Secondary ‚Äì Certified copies

### By quality

* Hearsay ‚Äì "he said she said" ‚Äì bad

* Direct ‚Äì Very good
* Corroborative ‚Äì Supportive

* Conclusive ‚Äì so good, that we can adjourn court after it.

## Evidence Rules

* **Best** ‚Äì Original evidence is **best** (not photocopies)
* **Parol** ‚Äì Written signed agreements can only be amended by written signed agreements (not **parol** evidence)
* **Hearsay** ‚Äì Anti-**hearsay** evidence rule. Evidence-giver must present themselves and not through a third-party.

## Backups

![image](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/pictures/incremental-vs-differential.png)  

* Full ‚Äì full
* Differential ‚Äì diff (**delta**) from full
* Incremental ‚Äì increments from last increment, thus there will be: **high quantity of increments** 

## Security encounters

* Security Event ‚Äì Anything worthwhile logging for security. For example: OS reboot, browser crash
* Security Incident ‚Äì Whatever breaches security policy and threatens organization
* Security Intrusion/Breach ‚Äì Security defenses breached

## Terms

* UCITA ‚Äì Law governing business transactions

### UEBA

UEBA = Bossware.

Mnemonic: Associate "UEBA" with "Urban"
* Whichever boss uses UEBA is an [**`ueban`** (on **Urban**Dictionary)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ueban)
	* UEBA*n* - can be thought as "u*r*ban cyberpunk" (cyberpunk surveillance)

## RAID

### RAID operations

* Striping ‚Äì Speed
* Mirroring ‚Äì Redundancy

Remember this array,

0 | 1
---- | -----
S | M

SM ‚Äì Like "Samsung" or "storage management",  
	![Samsung old-style logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/2/24/20170808112701%21Samsung_Logo.svg)

### Basic

* RAID 0 ‚Äì **S**triping ‚Äì 2x speed
* RAID 1 ‚Äì **M**irroring ‚Äì 2x redundancy

### Speed over reliability

* RAID 2 ‚Äì Byte striping for speed
* RAID 3 ‚Äì Block striping for speed. Block is bigger than byte, therefore RAID 3 > RAID 2.

### Error-corrective

* RAID 5 ‚Äì Data and parity striped
* RAID 6 ‚Äì Same as RAID 5, but configuration is safer with little overhead over RAID 5

### Nested

![raid-100](https://hardwaresfera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raid-100.jpg) |
---- |
*RAID 100*

The trick is to read nested RAID from bottom to the top. First digit from the **left** defines the drive level,

* RAID 01 ‚Äì (At drive level) **0** Striping, (At drive-set level) **1** Mirroring

* RAID 10 ‚Äì (At drive level) **1** Mirroring, (At drive-set level) **0** Striping

Let's try one more for fun,

* RAID 100 ‚Äì (At drive level) **1** Mirroring, (At drive-set level) **0** Striping, (At set of drive-sets level) **0** Striping

## Lockheed Martin ‚Äì Cyber Kill Chain

### Mnemonic 1: Story

Trojan War gives a good analogy:

1. Recon ‚Äì Greeks analyze Trojan city, culture, forces to find vulnerabilities, and find that Trojans are superstitious.
2. Weaponization ‚Äì Greeks design and build an exploit ‚Äì a Trojan Horse
3. Delivery ‚Äì Greeks discreetly deliver a Trojan Horse to the Trojan gates
4. Installation ‚Äì Trojan Horse is interacted with and installed inside Troy.
5. Exploitation ‚Äì Under the cover of the night, the Greek warriors disembark Trojan Horse and walk on small Trojan streets to avoid early detection.
6. Command & Control ‚Äì Greeks establish command and control over Troy
7. Maintain ‚Äì Greeks take measures to maintain control of the city as well as to seize the treasury of the previous king.

### Mnemonic 2: Shorter story

Recon weaponized, Delivery of exploit, exploit installed, Command and control maintained.

# Domain 8

## Controls

* (Change-)Request ‚Äì User can request modifications
* Change (Control) ‚Äì Developers can change what they do
	* Change Advisory Board (CAB) ‚Äì Approve/reject code changes
* Configuration ‚Äì Comply with configuration policies
* Release ‚Äì How software's released

User requests, developer changes, policy configures, software releases.

## Regarding sources

No source is perfect, including this one. Everyone makes mistakes, and I witnessed several contradicting opinions online about some hot topics (especially about Access Control Models, due diligence vs due care, DR). The *trick* is to consult multiple sources.

This set of mnemonics, like any other set, probably only covers 40% of all exam topics. For the remainder 60%, you need to study books. The mnemonics are a **result** of thorough studies, not a replacement of studies.

Also, try to make multiple mental connections to the CISSP topics. Through experience, language (like "Zero KODU"), cursing etc. Don't be that guy, who passed CISSP and forgot what Bell-LaPadula is. During the exam, it's one too easy not to remember something, and I could answer some of the hard questions through thoroughly mentally consulting the topics I studied.

For CISSP, the right way is (ISC)¬≤ way (and to give credit, they are *at least* almost always right). 

CISSP mnemonics do not, and cannot, replace going through all CISSP topics.

I recommend,

### ‚Ññ1

* Official (ISC)¬≤ CISSP publications

### Other mnemonic repositories

* ~~[DerreckM/CISSP-Mnemonics](https://github.com/DerreckM/CISSP-Mnemonics)~~ ([mirror](https://github.com/khwajaimran/CISSP-Mnemonics))
* [TheRealBenForce/cissp-mnemonics](https://github.com/TheRealBenForce/cissp-mnemonics)

## Overall tips

* Read questions multiple times, to decipher what is being asked.
* If an issue affects both confidentiality and integrity ‚Äì then it mainly affects confidentiality.
* If an issue affects Least Privilege and Separation of Duties ‚Äì then it mainly affects Separation of Duties.
* Think like a technical manager ‚Äì not a senior techie.
* Order of criticality: Humans > Laws&Regulations > Company > Computer hardware
* External opinion about security is always more objective than internal.
* End game matters. Yes, you have an 'amazing' trick to keep your organization secure. Will it still function as expected in 5-10 years?

## (ISC)¬≤ Code of Ethics

### Code

* Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.
* Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
* Provide diligent and competent service to principals.
* Advance and protect the profession.

### Memorization

1) Protect (commonwealth)
2) Act (well)
3) Provide (service)
4) Advance (profession)

### Shortcuts

P-A-P-A
